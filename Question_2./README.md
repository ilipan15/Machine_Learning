## Assignment outline

Simulate a three-class dataset with 50 observations in each class and two features. Make
sure that this dataset is not linearly separable.

- Make a scatter plot to show your dataset. 

- Split the dataset to a training set (50%) and a test set (50%). Train the support vector machine with a linear kernel, a polynomial kernel and an RBF kernel on the training data. The parameters associated with each model should be tuned by 5-fold cross-validation. Test the models on the test data and discuss the results.
