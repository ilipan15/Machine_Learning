## Assignment outline

Use the [German credit](https://github.com/ilipan15/Machine_Learning/blob/main/data/GermanCredit.csv) data. Split the data to a training set (70%) and a test set (30%).

- Fit a decision tree to the training data with an optimal tree size determined by 5-fold cross-validation. Create a plot of the pruned tree and interpret the results. Compute the test error rate of the pruned tree.

- Fit a random forest to the training data with the parameter of the number of features to create the splits tuned by 5-fold cross-validation. Set the number of trees to 1000. Compute the test error rate and comment on the results. Create a plot showing variable importance for the model with the tuned parameter and comment on the
plot. 

- Draw one plot with two ROC curves for the test predictions in (1) and (2).
